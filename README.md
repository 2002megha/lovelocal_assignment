EASY 1

step 1-user to enter a string and stores it in the variable 'string'

step 2-The string is reversed using python slice notation ('[::-1]') and stored in the variable 'str1'.

step 3-Initialize a variable 'count' to zero.

step 4-This is a 'for' loop that iterates over each character in the reversed string('str1').For each character,it checks if it is a space.If it encounters a space,the loop will terminate using the 'break' statement.if the character is not a space,it increments the 'count' variable.

step 5-print the value of the count

MEDIUM 2

step 1-Initializes a list named 'values'

step 2-Calculates the value of 'n' which is one-third of the length of the 'values' list using the integer division operator '//'.

step 3-Creates an empty dictionary named 'count' to store the count of occurrences of each element in the 'values' list

step 4-Empty list named 'ans'to store the elements that occur more than 'n' times.

step 5-Iterate through each element in the'values' list.If the element 'i' is already a key in the 'count' dictionary,it increaments the count.Otherwise,it adds a new key with a count of 1.

step 6-Iterates through the items in the 'count' dictionary.if the count 'i' for a particular ele is greater than 'n'.

step 6-print the list 'ans'.

HARD 3

step 1-user to enter a integer and stores it in the variable 'n' Initializes a variable named 'count' to 0.

step 2-Initializes a variable named 'count' to 0.which is used to count the occurrences of the digit '1'in the range of nums.

step 3-For loop that iterates over the range from 0 to 'n'.

step 4-Converts the current number 'i'to a string then creates list of elements.

step 5-For each digit in list 'values',it checks if the digit is equal to 1,and increment the count variable.

step 6-print the total count
